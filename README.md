# TryHackMe Labs — Rhythm Sarma

This repo contains my TryHackMe room writeups. Each room has its own folder under `rooms/` with step-by-step commands, notes, and screenshots.

## Structure
- `rooms/<room-name>/README.md` — full writeup for the room
- `rooms/<room-name>/commands.txt` — copyable commands used
- `rooms/<room-name>/media/` — screenshots

## How I use it
1. Create a new folder for each room I finish.  
2. Add a `README.md` with objective, steps, answers/flags (if any), and lessons learned.  
3. Commit and push, then share on LinkedIn (one short post per room).

**Lab-only:** Do not include real IPs or anything that violates TryHackMe rules.
